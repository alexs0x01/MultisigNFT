Using this area for brainstorming:

multisig nfts involve several people/wallets

they create an nft together, and can then use said NFT as a collective to make decisions

what decisions can they make? votes, investment, add cosigner, remove cosigner

TODO:

 - adjust all variable names in contract (state vs param vars)


it should be ok to have owners, because that's part of what can make each NFT valuable and tradeable
however, the owner should not be able to do anything with the NFT without creating a proposal and having
co-signers vote on it just like any other member

for instance, an nft project might want to create a multisig nft for it's holders to do group investments
or pool funds for liquidity pools for tokens or their own NFT collection market makers

i need to figure out a way that I can add actions into the future so that I can get an initial version published
and make incremental upgrades to the project, or just think of everything from the jump
